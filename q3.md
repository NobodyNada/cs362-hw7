# Question 3
## Jonathan Keller

From my social media system (YouTube), I will select the database system for storing video metadata such as views, likes, and comments. To develop it using a TDD approach, I would:

- Create a test that attempts to insert a video into the database and ensures the insertion completes successfully
- Implement the "insert video" function
- Create a test that attempts to retrieve a video from the database, access some of its properties, and delete the video
- Implement the "retrieve video" and "delete video" functions
- Create a test that retrives a video several times and ensures that its view counter increases
- Implement the functionality to increment the view counter when a video is viewed
- Create a test that attempts to add comments to a video
- Implement the "add comment" function
- Create a test that attempts to query comments on a video
- Implement the comment-retrieval function
